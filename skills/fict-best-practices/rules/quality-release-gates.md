## Run Compiler and Runtime Release Gates Before Merge

Use reproducible gate commands before merging compiler/runtime changes. A patch
is not release-ready until tests, type checks, strict diagnostics, and
performance guards all pass.

**Incorrect (partial verification):**

```bash
pnpm --filter @fictjs/compiler test
```

**Correct (full gate sequence):**

```bash
export BENCH_OUTPUT="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/fict-optimizer-bench.json"
pnpm release:verify
```
